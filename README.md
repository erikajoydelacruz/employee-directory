# Employee Directory Using Fetch API (Treehouse Techdegree)

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources. I used the Fetch API to gather random data including addresses, phone numbers, photos, and names to create an employee directory for an imaginary company. 

This was my first time using the Fetch API and gathering data, so it was a struggle at first to call the data. However, following the study guide I was given helped me to call the data. I still need to study about the Fetch API and how to connect to different APIs.
